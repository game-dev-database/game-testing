	abstract = {? 2014 IEEE.The quality of game is one of the factors that may stop the release of a game. Game testing can be used to measure the game quality. Unfortunately, most game testing use user-centric approach to test the quality of the game. In this paper, we propose a game testing method, which is developed from the existing game testing approach supplemented with software testing approach to measure the game quality. The game quality was derived from software engineering quality model standards and game quality model. The proposed game testing method is applied to several case studies. The case studies have demonstrated how to assess the games in order to obtain the meaningful results. The research found that the game quality results can be used by game developers to improve the game.},

This imbalance is a problem if video game development differs from general software development, as some game experts suggest. In this paper we describe a study with 14 interviewees and 364 survey respondents. The study elicited substantial differences between video game development and other software development. For example, in game development, “cowboy coders” are necessary to cope with the continuous interplay between creative desires and technical constraints. Consequently, game developers are hesitant to use automated testing because of these tests’ rapid obsolescence in the face of shifting creative desires of game designers. These differences between game and non-game development have implications for research, industry, and practice. For instance, as a starting point for impacting game development, researchers could create testing tools that enable game developers to create tests that assert flexible behavior with little up-front investment.},

This position paper presents a qualitative study that sought to discover who takes the role of play-testers and what kind of feedback play-testers generate in the early stages of RE for games. The case study responds to the observation that no textbook on RE or software engineering addresses play-testing as a phenomenon, and that classic Computer Science programs at universities teach testing techniques mostly in the context of embedded systems, hence students often are left with little opportunity to develop testing skills that build upon play-testing practices happening in the game development sector. The study therefore was aimed at identifying important implications that play-testing may have for research and teaching.},

Hence, an exploratory survey was conducted to determine the practice of, and perception of agile game development in New Zealand. The results show that while studios universally state and perceive that they use the agile framework Scrum and sometimes Kanban, their actual practices often differ from these frameworks in key areas. Furthermore, studios collectively overestimated their level of adherence with Scrum.

Regardless of the size of the organization and/or team, the complexity of the development related to the production of such software is similar. In order to deliver high quality games, the practitioners carry out software tests during the production of their indie games. These tests aim to analyze the speciﬁc characteristics of this type of software, such as the degree of entertainment and playability aspects. However, there still no consensus about how the test activities are performed during the development process of indie games. This paper presents a survey to identify the test practices during the development of indie games, aiming to understand how these activities are performed. As a result, we identiﬁed that developers worry about the execution of tests during the development of indie games, focusing on techniques that consider more than one inherent aspects of the game.

Then, we have analyzed the occurrence of the studied smells in 100 opensource Unity projects, and also assessed UnityLinter’s accuracy. Results of our empirical investigation indicate that developers wellreceived performance- and behavior-related issues, while some maintainability issues are more controversial. UnityLinter is, in general, accurate enough in detecting smells (86\%-100\% precision and 50\%-100\% recall), and our study shows that the studied smell types occur in 39\%-97\% of the analyzed projects.},

Game industry testing practices often rely on human testers to assure the quality of a game prior to release. 
 
This thesis investigates the question of whether the testing and validation of computer graphics implementations for cross-platform game development can be automated to reduce the burden on human testers, accelerate the testing phase, and improve the quality of games. Using Design Science Research methods and patterns, iterative development and evaluation is undertaken to construct artefacts, drawing upon prior research and industrial works in related fields such as film and television, as well as proprietary game development insight. Elements of existing automated testing systems and image comparison techniques are combined with industry standard cross-platform development tools and methods to create a reusable and generalisable model of an automated test system, featuring image comparison methods, and record and playback techniques for cross-platform game implementations. 
 
In conclusion, this thesis shows that it is possible to create a novel system that is able to detect graphical defects in output from a cross-platform game implementation.},

Game companies traditionally relied on user-testing methods, like playtesting, surveys or videotaping, to obtain player feedback. However, these qualitative methods for data collection are time-consuming and the obtained data is often incomplete or subjective. Therefore, instrumentation became popular in recent years to unobtrusively obtain the detailed data required to thoroughly evaluate player behavior. To make sense of the large amount of data, appropriate tools and visualizations have been developed. This article reviews literature on visualization-based analysis of game metric data in order to give an overview of the current state of this emerging field of research. We discuss issues related to gameplay analysis, propose a broad categorization of visualization techniques and discuss their characteristics.

For example, combining data from players’ physiological measures with questionnaire or interview results and in-game movement data into a single report is not straightforward because the underlying data is often in different formats. Visualization techniques can facilitate the understanding of relationships among these data sets. Although various visualization techniques have already been introduced in GUR, most of these techniques only focus on displaying large amounts of data captured directly via telemetry without integrating qualitative or contextual data on players’ emotional experience. Hence, here we propose a novel visualization approach to triangulate the above mentioned mixed data sources.},

Visualization techniques are currently being employed to help integrate quantitative and qualitative data. Despite that, two existing challenges are to determine the level of detail to be presented to developers based on their needs and to effectively communicate the collected data so that informed design changes can be reached. In this paper, we first propose an aggregated visualization technique that makes use of clustering, territory tessellation, and trajectory aggregation to simultaneously display mixed playtesting data. Secondly, to assess the usefulness of our technique we evaluate it through interviews with professional game developers and compare it to a non-aggregated visualization. The results of this study also provide an important contribution towards identifying areas of improvement in the portrayal of gameplay data.},

Modern developers apply Games User Research (GUR) methods to make informed game design decisions based on their target audience. Traditional methods include observation, interview, and questionnaires. In order to obtain detailed user or gameplay information, complementary methods might be required. We analyze the inclusion of two affordable complementary methods, namely webcam-based eye-tracking and telemetry, along with data visualization in a playtesting routine. By developing three versions of a hardcore 2D platform game that demands multitasking abilities using different GUR methods, we were able to ﬁnd that the chosen complementary methods cover a signiﬁcant amount of gameplay issues. The metrics and eye-tracking data visualization provided insights about multitasking and level design. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges of evaluating prototypes regarding a more enjoyable experience when frustration is a desirable gameplay element.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of internet-enabled gaming devices enables game developers nowadays to remotely and unobtrusively monitor every aspect of a game, allowing them to accumulate large amounts of data of the player-game interaction over extended time periods. This data has become a viable source for developers to guide decision-making throughout the game design process and even after the game has been released, for example, to identify balancing issues (Kim, et al., 2008; Zoeller, 2010), to understand player movement (Moura, El-Nasr and Shaw, 2011), to reduce production costs (Hullett, et al., 2011), or to uncover bugs (Zoeller, 2010), to name but a few. At the same time, the increasing popularity of online multiplayer gaming has attached great importance to in-game statistics to allow players to recap their performance and to compare it with others. This growing interest in game telemetry data is reflected by the emergence of the new field of game analytics--concerned with the discovery and communication of meaningful patterns in data as applied in the context of game development and game research (cf. El-Nasr, Drachen and Canossa, 2013). Game analytics heavily relies on visualization techniques to assist developers and players alike to understand, analyze, and explore the data (cf. Wallner and Kriglstein, 2013). Visualizations in game research can be helpful to discover unexpected paths which have been taken by the players, to identify possible design and balancing problems, or to find common patterns in the behavior of the players. Moreover, since the rich interaction possibilities provided by a game can give rise to emergent behavior which is hard to anticipate, visualizations can assist in exploratory data analysis helping the analyst to discover potentially interesting structures, trends, and anomalies not thought of beforehand.},

In this paper behavioral profiling through Archetype Analysis is combined with progression analysis, expanding on previous work in the area, and extending it into the context of Open-World Games. The proposed methodological framework is applied to the case of the action-adventure title Just Cause 2, focusing on the main storyline. The results show how players navigate the content of the title, and how some playstyles remain constant throughout the game, whereas others emerge or disappear with player progress. Additionally, player performance as a function of progression is evaluated across a number of key metrics.},

Created during the development of the commercial game Angus Hates Aliens, in collaboration with indie developer Team Stendec, our death-related problem level likelihood indicator (DPLI) is interpretable and actionable, i.e., it easily allowed the developer to know where to fix the game levels. Finally, DPLI correlated to enjoyment ratings for the game levels, suggesting that it was a good indicator of problems in the context of our prototype evaluation.},

Our system, called ARAPID (As Rapid As Possible Iterative Design), manages playtesting from a control panel in Unity and recruits players from Mechanical Turk. With this system, game designers can launch playtests and visualize results directly in the editor. To better understand and evaluate this approach, we ran three studies on two basic platform games. First, a game designer used ARAPID to playtest and rapidly iterate on the design of the games; we found the games were improved toward specific design goals. Second, we analyzed the impact of different forms of recruitment on playtesting speed; we found that pre-recruitment and over-recruitment of players can reduce the time needed to run playtests. Third, we analyzed the impact of players' familiarity with the game on the precision of playtest results; we found that whether or not players are allowed to replay the game can impact results.},

The uncontrolled change management foresees an increase in the complexity of the methods and classes in an application, which sometimes result in poor quality. The number of OSS projects dealing with computer game development are on the increase, which lead to more research interests in assessing the quality of OSS resulting products. Some studies that deal with the evaluating the OSS quality, concerns use user’s survey approach focusing on the usability aspects. The empirical investigations to evaluate the quality concerns of the design, using internal code attributes, needs attention of researchers. In this study, we aim to investigate the quality concerns of the design complexity of methods in OSS computer game applications using internal code attributes. We use three quality criteria, namely correctness, reliability and maintainability from the set of six factors of ISO 9126 model. We collect data from 55 OSS computer game applications and use various statistical analysis techniques to examine the research question of this study. We conclude that the methods of the OSS computer game applications demonstrate an acceptable level of quality in the three criteria of correctness, reliability and maintainability.},

So far, testing a game’s functional features relies mainly on human testers, who personally plays the game, and is thus labor intensive. This paper proposes a method that automates game testing. Since games are usually built on top of game frameworks, the idea is to enhance a game framework with a testing layer, which can execute (playback) test scripts that perform user events and assert the correctness of the game. We design an HTML5 game framework with such a support. In addition, a case study is performed to compare the testing cost of three different methods: writing a test script directly, recording a test script, and testing the game directly by a human tester. The results showed that when repeated testings are necessary, an automatic testing (either writing or recording test scripts) can reduce human cost. Among these three testing methods, recording scripts was the most favored method.},

Thus, game development projects use feedback from game testers to understand what they think of various features and concepts, to obtain a better understanding of problem spaces. This study proposes that game tester feedback moderates the effect of Sprint planning on game quality. A field study was conducted using a pair-matched questionnaire in which 102 game development projects participated. Results showed that Sprint planning has a positive effect on game quality. The results also revealed that iterative feedback has a moderating effect on the relationship between Sprint planning and game quality. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {Playtesting, or using play to guide game design, gives designers feedback about whether their game is meeting their goals and the player's expectations. We report a case study of designing, deploying, and iterating on a series of playtesting workshops for novice game designers. We identify common missteps made by novice designers and address these missteps through the concept of purposefulness, understanding why you are playtesting as well as how to playtest. We ground our workshops in the development of rich player experience goals, which inform playtest design, data collection and iteration. We show that by applying methods taught in our workshops, novice game designers leveraged playtest methods and tools, employed playtesting and data collection methods appropriate for their goals, and effectively applied playtest data in iterative design. We conclude with lessons learned and next steps in our research on playtesting.},

	abstract = {Game studios aim to develop titles that deliver a fun and engaging experience for players. Playtesting promises to help identify opportunities to improve player experience and assist developers in achieving their design intent. However, a lack of research on the added value of playtesting means that many studios are still uncertain about its commercial viability and impact on product success. This gap in understanding is further complicated by the vague definition of "success" afforded by sales figures and review scores. In this paper, we assess reported feature quality of three commercial titles by analyzing playtesting reports and game reviews. By comparing themes and design issues expressed in game reviews to the results of pre-release playtesting for each game, we aim to highlight the value of playtesting and propose a set of guidelines for selecting playtest methods based on the needs of a given game evaluation. Through the real-world case studies presented, this paper contributes to the growing domain of games user research and highlights the value of playtesting in game development.},

The problem setting consists of an image (800x800 RGB) as input to be classified into one of five defined classes, normal image, or one of four different kinds of glitches (stretched, low resolution, missing and placeholder textures). Using a supervised approach, we train a ShuffleNetV2 using generated data. This work focuses on detecting texture graphical anomalies achieving arguably good performance with an accuracy of 86.8\%, detecting 88\% of the glitches with a false positive rate of 8.7\%, and with the models being able to generalize and detect glitches even in unseen objects. We apply a confidence measure as well to tackle the issue with false positives as well as an effective way of aggregating images to achieve better detection in production. The main use of this work is the partial automatization of graphical testing in the final stages of video game development.},

MCTS and its enhancements are controlled by multiple parameters that require extensive and time-consuming offline optimization. Moreover, as the played games are unknown in advance, offline optimization cannot tune parameters specifically for single games. This paper proposes a self-adaptive MCTS strategy (SA-MCTS) that integrates within the search a method to automatically tune search-control parameters online per game. It presents five different allocation strategies that decide how to allocate available samples to evaluate parameter values. Experiments with 1 s play-clock on multiplayer games show that for all the allocation strategies the performance of SA-MCTS that tunes two parameters is at least equal to or better than the performance of MCTS tuned offline and not optimized per-game. The allocation strategy that performs the best is N-Tuple Bandit Evolutionary Algorithm (NTBEA). This strategy also achieves a good performance when tuning four parameters. SA-MCTS can be considered as a successful strategy for domains that require parameter tuning for every single problem, and it is also a valid alternative for domains where offline parameter tuning is costly or infeasible.},

Our primary contribution is to combine AI gameplay using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with a simulation of how the player population evolves over the levels. The AI players predict level difficulty, which is used to drive a player population model with simulated skill, persistence, and boredom. This allows us to model, e.g., how less persistent and skilled players are more sensitive to high difficulty, and how such players churn early, which makes the player population and the relation between difficulty and churn evolve level by level. Our work demonstrates that player behavior predictions produced by DRL gameplay can be significantly improved by even a very simple population-level simulation of individual player differences, without requiring costly retraining of agents or collecting new DRL gameplay data for each simulated player.},

For instance, test scripts that perform sanity checks of the proper functioning of a mobile game would be desirable in an ecosystem with constant hotﬁxes and updates, as well as a diverse set of conﬁgurations (e.g., device hardware, screensizes, and platforms). In this context, this paper reports an experience on developing automated test scripts for mobile games. To this end, we randomly selected 16 mobile games, from different genres, among the popular ones from the Google Play Store. For each game, test scripts were developed using the Appium testing framework and the OpenCV library. Based on our results, we provide an in-depth discussion on the challenges and lessons learned.},

	abstract = {3D applications have travelled great lengths over the past few years as users are more accustomed towards visual environment and interactive media such as 3D games. One of the major concerns of 3D mobile game development is to provide interactive source of entertainment. Testing a 3D gaming is more complex and subjective then general mobile applications. A bug in general mobile application can be compromised in its first release but this might not work for a 2D or 3D gaming application. Any deficit in performance, graphics, logic and compatibility is simply rejected in the current saturated market. The testing approaches used for 3D visualization applications are either manual based or using automated testing tools, although one needs to be fully equipped with the domain knowledge and working of the automated tool for it to be useful. In this paper, we have proposed an adaptive usage based statistical testing (A-UBST) that adapts with the user experiences. This technique enables the quality engineers and testers to focus on the frequently accessed parts of SUT (software under test). We have used Markov Models to represent usage models. We demonstrated our approach with respect to 3D game. Our comparison results show the suitability of the approach for 3D gaming applications by reducing testing effort, time and cost metrics.},

	abstract = {To enable automated software testing, the ability to automatically navigate to a state of interest and to explore all, or at least sufficient number of, instances of such a state is fundamental. When testing a computer game the problem has an extra dimension, namely the virtual world where the game is played on. This world often plays a dominant role in constraining which logical states are reachable, and how to reach them. So, any automated testing algorithm for computer games will inevitably need a layer that deals with navigation on a virtual world. Unlike e.g. navigating through the GUI of a typical web-based application, navigating over a virtual world is much more challenging. This paper discusses how concepts from geometry and graph-based path finding can be applied in the context of game testing to solve the problem of automated navigation and exploration. As a proof of concept, the paper also briefly discusses the implementation of the proposed approach.},

A very promising strategy is model-based testing that is aimed to automatically generate test cases and evaluate test results based on the software models that specify the behavior of the software under test. In this paper, we propose a general rule model for mobile games by combining the features of the game software and the Wireless Application Protocol. We also build an adjusted model for generating test cases with the characteristics of mobile game software. A series of patterns are created to facilitate the generation of TTCN-3 test suite and test case. A case study on the Fruit Machine game is discussed to illustrate the use of the proposed model for software testing.},

This study reports a preliminary investigation into this under-researched area. We interviewed eight video game producers from a range of companies, using a critical incident method to explore risk management practices and risk perceptions. Our results revealed that in lieu of formal risk management practices, these managers relied on prototyping, pre-production decision points, and agile approaches to contain risk on their projects. Among the risk factors mentioned, two are specific to the unique context of video game development. The risk of failing to match the development strategy to the project was identified as a major cause of problems during the development process, and a new risk - the 'fun factor' - was a key element threatening the success of the final game release. © 2014 IEEE.},

Both the eye gaze and head pose components utilize underlying 3D models, while the expression recognition module uses the effective but efficient LBP-TOP approach. We then demonstrate the utility of this system in a test application wherein the user looks at one of three non-player characters (NPC) and performs one of the 7 prototypic expressions; the NPC responds based on its personality. To increase the speed and efficiency of the system, the eye gaze and expression recognition modules leverage CUDA and GLSL pixel shaders.},

	abstract = {Context: Currently, computer game development is one of the fastest growing industries in the worldwide economy. In addition to that, computer games are rapidly evolving in the sense that newer game versions arrive in a very short interval. Thus, software engineering techniques are needed for game development in order to achieve greater flexibility and maintainability, less cost and effort, better design, etc. In addition, games present several characteristics that differentiate their development from classical software development. Objective: This study aims to assess the state of the art on research concerning software engineering for computer games and discuss possible important areas for future research. Method: We employed a standard methodology for systematic literature reviews using four well known digital libraries. Results: Software engineering for computer games is a research domain that has doubled its research activity during the last 5 years. The dominant research topic has proven to be requirements engineering, while topics such as software verification and maintenance have been neglected up to now. Conclusion: The results of the study suggest that software engineering for computer games is a field that embraces many techniques and methods from conventional software engineering and adapts them so as to fit the specific requirements of game development. In addition to that, the study proposes the employment of more elaborate empirical methods, i.e. controlled experiments and case studies, in game software engineering research, which, have not been extensively used up to now. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

	doi = {10.1109/SNPD.2017.8022767},
	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) agent created with Deep Q-Networks (DQN) can defeat human agents in video games. Despite its high performance, DQN often exhibits odd behaviors, which could be immersion-breaking against the purpose of creating game AI. Moreover, DQN is capable of reacting to the game environment much faster than humans, making itself invincible (thus not fun to play with) in certain types of games. On the other hand, supervised learning framework trains an AI agent using historical play data of human agents as training data. Supervised learning agent exhibits a more human-like behavior than reinforcement learning agents because of imitating training data. However, its performance is often no better than human agents. The ultimate purpose of AI agents is to entertain human players. A good performance and a human-like behavior are important factors of the AI agents, and both of them should be achieved simultaneously. This study proposes frameworks combining reinforcement learning and supervised learning and we call then separated network model and shared network model. We evaluated their performances by the game scores and behaviors by Turing test. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed frameworks develop an AI agent of better performance than human agent and natural behavior than reinforcement learning agents.},

Game jams have received more public attention in recent times, but the concept itself has not been formally discussed so far. A game jam is a composition of design and development strategies: new product development, participatory design, lightweight construction, rapid experience prototyping, product-value focusing, aesthetics and technology, concurrent development and multidisciplinarity. Although game jams are normally used for rapid prototyping of small computer games, the constellation of the mentioned elements provides a powerful technique for rapidly prototyping new product ideas and disruptive innovations.},

Digital versions have also appeared, with HearthStone: Heroes of WarCraftTM being one of the most popular. In Hearthstone, every player can play as a hero, from a set of nine, and build his/her deck before the game from a big pool of available cards, including both neutral and hero-specific cards. This kind of games offers several challenges for researchers in artificial intelligence since they involve hidden information, unpredictable behaviour, and a large and rugged search space. Besides, an important part of player engagement in such games is a periodical input of new cards in the system, which mainly opens the door to new strategies for the players. Playtesting is the method used to check the new card sets for possible design flaws, and it is usually performed manually or via exhaustive search; in the case of Hearthstone, such test plays must take into account the chosen hero, with its specific kind of cards. In this paper, we present a novel idea to improve and accelerate the playtesting process, systematically exploring the space of possible decks using an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). This EA creates HearthStone decks which are then played by an AI versus established human-designed decks. Since the space of possible combinations that are play-tested is huge, search through the space of possible decks has been shortened via a new heuristic mutation operator, which is based on the behaviour of human players modifying their decks. Results show the viability of our method for exploring the space of possible decks and automating the play-testing phase of game design. The resulting decks, that have been examined for balancedness by an expert player, outperform human-made ones when played by the AI; the introduction of the new heuristic operator helps to improve the obtained solutions, and basing the study on the whole set of heroes shows its validity through the whole range of decks.},

TD game is a game where player(s) need to build tower to prevent the creeps from reaching their based. Penalty will be given if player losses any creeps during gameplays. It is a suitable test bed for planning, designing, implementing and testing either new or modified AI techniques due to the complexity and dynamicity of the game. In this research, Genetic Algorithm (GA) will be implemented to the game with two different neural networks: (1) Feed- forward (FFNN) and (2) Elman Recurrent (ERNN) used as tuner of the weights. ANN will determine the placement of the towers and the fitness score will be calculated at the end of each game. As a result, it is proven that the implementation of GA towards FFNN is better compared to GA towards ERNN.},

	abstract = {In order to automatically generate high-quality game levels, one needs to be able to automatically verify that the levels are playable. The simulation-based approach to playability testing uses an artificial agent to play through the level, but building such an agent is not always an easy task and such an agent is not always readily available. We discuss this problem in the context of the physics-based puzzle game Cut the Rope, which features continuous time and state space, making several approaches such as exhaustive search and reactive agents inefficient. We show that a deliberative Prolog-based agent can be used to suggest all sensible moves at each state, which allows us to restrict the search space so that depth-first search for solutions become viable. This agent is successfully used to test playability in Ropossum, a level generator based on grammatical evolution. The method proposed in this paper is likely to be useful for a large variety of games with similar characteristics.},

Designers usually explore this space through human playtesting, which can be time-consuming and of limited effectiveness in exhausting the space of possible behaviors. In this paper, we propose the use of automated planning agents to simulate humans of varying skill levels to generate game playthroughs. Metrics can then be gathered from these playthroughs to evaluate the current game design and identify its potential flaws. We demonstrate this technique in two games: the popular word game Scrabble and a collectible card game of our own design named Cardonomicon. Using these case studies, we show how using simulated agents to model humans of varying skill levels allows us to extract metrics to describe game balance (in the case of Scrabble) and highlight potential design flaws (in the case of Cardonomicon).},

We demonstrate our techniques using simulated game play and actual game data from over 106 million play sessions of a popular online Flappy Bird variant, showing quantitative reasons why balancing a game for a wide range of player skill can be difficult. Some applications of our techniques include searching for a specific difficulty, game space visualization, computational creativity to find unique variants, and tuning game balance to adjust the difficulty curve even when game parameters are time varying, score dependent, or changing based on game progress.},

However, human gameplay data is expensive to acquire relative to the coverage of a game that it provides. We show that off-the-shelf automatic exploration strategies can explore with an effectiveness comparable to human gameplay on the same timescale. We contribute generic methods for quantifying exploration quality as a function of time and demonstrate our metric on several elementary techniques and human players on a collection of commercial games sampled from multiple game platforms (from Atari 2600 to Nintendo 64).

We test this kind of network on the Jelly Juice game, a match-3 video game developed by the redBit Games. The network extracts the essential information from the game environment and infers the next move. We compare the results with the random player performance, finding that the network shows a highest success rate. The results are in most cases similar with those obtained by real users, and the network also succeeds in learning over time the different features that distinguish the game levels and adapts its strategy to the increasing difficulties.},

Although studies on playtesting in Match 3 games have attempted to utilize Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the applicability of these methods are limited because the associated training is time-consuming and data collection is difficult. To address this problem, game playtesting was performed via learning based on strategic play in Match 3 games. Five strategic plays were defined in the Match 3 game under consideration and game playtesting was performed for each situation via reinforcement learning. The proposed agent performed within a 5\% margin of human performance on the most complex mission in the experiment. We demonstrate that it is possible for the level designer to measure the difficulty of the level via playtesting various missions. This study also provides level testing standards for several types of missions in Match 3 games.},

In this paper, four different game-playing agents that embody different playing styles are defined and used to analyze Ticket to Ride. Different playing styles are shown to be effective depending on the map and rule variation, and also depending on how many players play the game. The performance profiles of the different agents can be used to characterize maps and identify the most similar maps in the space of playstyles. Further analysis of the automatically played games reveal which cities on the map are most desirable, and that the relative attractiveness of cities is remarkably consistent across numbers of players. Finally, the automated analysis also reveals two classes of failures states, where the agents find states which are not covered by the game rules; this is akin to finding bugs in the rules. We see the analysis performed here as a possible template for AI-based playtesting of contemporary board games.},

Balancing is difficult and time-consuming, as designers must repeatedly tweak parameters, and run lengthy playtests to evaluate the effects of these changes. If designers could receive immediate feedback on their designs, they could explore a vast space of variations, and select only the most promising games for playtesting. Such automated design feedback has been difficult to achieve, as there is no mathematical formulation of game balance that unifies many of its forms. We argue for a formulation in which carefully restricted agents are played against standard agents. We develop this restricted-play balance framework, and evaluate its utility by building a tool capable of calculating measures of balance for a large family of games. By applying this tool to an educational card game, we demonstrate how the framework and tool allow designers to rapidly evaluate and iterate on the balance of their games.},

Playtesting, however, is expensive: human testers must be recruited, playtest results must be aggregated and interpreted, and changes to game designs must be extrapolated from these results. Can automated methods reduce this expense? We show how active learning techniques can formalize and automate a subset of playtesting goals. Specifically, we focus on the low-level parameter tuning required to balance a game once the mechanics have been chosen. Through a case study on a shoot-`em-up game we demonstrate the efficacy of active learning to reduce the amount of playtesting needed to choose the optimal set of game parameters for two classes of (formal) design objectives. This work opens the potential for additional methods to reduce the human burden of performing playtesting for a variety of relevant design concerns.},

In this paper, we study the problem of training intelligent agents in service of game development. Unlike the agents built to "beat the game", our agents aim to produce human-like behavior to help with game evaluation and balancing. We discuss two fundamental metrics based on which we measure the human-likeness of agents, namely skill and style, which are multi-faceted concepts with practical implications outlined in this paper. We report four case studies in which the style and skill requirements inform the choice of algorithms and metrics used to train agents; ranging from A* search to state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning. We, further, show that the learning potential of state-of-the-art deep RL models does not seamlessly transfer from the benchmark environments to target ones without heavily tuning their hyperparameters, leading to linear scaling of the engineering efforts and computational cost with the number of target domains.},

	title = {Machine {Learning} for {Semi}-{Automated} {Gameplay} {Analysis}},
	abstract = {Compelling gameplay requires constant testing and refinement during the development process, amounting to a considerable investment in time and energy. This article presents an approach to gameplay analysis intended to support and augment the work of game designers, collecting and summarizing gameplay information from the game engine so designers can quickly evaluate the behaviour to make decisions. Using readily available machine learning technologies, a reusable tool has been constructed that can repeatedly choose scenarios to examine, run them through the game engine, and then construct concise and informative summaries of the engine's behaviour for designers. Based on the past scenarios, new scenarios are intelligently chosen to verify uncertain conclusions and refine the analysis. Game designers can examine the summaries produced by the analyzer, typically with a secondary visualization tool, providing the essential human judgement on what constitutes reasonable and entertaining behaviour. The inevitable role of the designer is why we use the term `semi-automated'. The analysis tool, SAGA-ML (Semi-Automated Gampeplay Analysis by Machine Learning), is based on machine learning research known as 'active learning', and has been used to evaluate Electronic Arts' FIFA'99 soccer game, uncovering some interesting anomalies in gameplay. With only minor changes, the tool was interfaced to FIFA 2004, and plays an active, in-house role in the development and testing of the FIFA series. While designed and developed in this context, the analysis tool is general purpose, requiring only a thin interface layer to be written to connect to different game engines. For the specific case of FIFA, a visualization tool, SoccerViz, has also been developed. SAGA-ML and SoccerViz were designed and developed by the University of Alberta GAMES group in cooperation with Electronic Arts.},

In this paper, we demonstrate the use of deep player behavior models to represent a player population (n = 213) of the massively multiplayer online role-playing game Aion, which are used, in turn, to generate individual agent behaviors. Results demonstrate significant balance differences in opposing enemy encounters and show how these can be regulated.

CCS and CCSS are non-deterministic match-3 puzzle games with multiple game modes spread over a few thousand levels, providing a diverse testbed for this technique.

AI Factory Spades, currently the top rated Spades game in the Google Play store, uses a variant of MCTS to control non-player characters. In collaboration with the developers, we collected gameplay data from 27,592 games and showed in a previous study that the playstyle of human players signiﬁcantly differed from that of the nonplayer characters.

The methods of player modelling and biasing MCTS presented in this study are generally applicable to digital games with discrete actions.},

The human-like agent uses test goals extracted by our proposed multiple greedy-policy inverse reinforcement learning (MGP-IRL) algorithm from tester trajectories. We use our agents to produce test sequences, and run the game with these sequences. At each run, we use an automated test oracle to check for bugs. We compared the success of human-like and synthetic agents in bug finding, and evaluated the similarity between human-like agents and human testers. We collected 427 trajectories from human testers using the GVG-AI framework and created three testbed games with 12 levels that contain 45 bugs.

Using these personas we demonstrate how generative player models can be applied to a varied corpus of game levels and demonstrate how different play styles can be enacted in each level. In short, we use artificially intelligent personas to construct synthetic playtesters. The proposed approach could be used as a tool for automatic play testing when human feedback is not readily available or when quick visualization of potential interactions is necessary. Possible applications include interactive tools during game development or procedural content generation systems where many evaluations must be conducted within a short time span.},

This integration approach has shown great success in Go-playing systems like AlphaGo and AlphaZero, but until now has not been available to those outside of artificial intelligence labs. Our system expands the Monster Carlo machine playtesting framework for Unity games by integrating its tree search capabilities with the behavior cloning features of Unity's Machine Learning Agents Toolkit. Because experience gained in one playthrough may now usefully transfer to other playthroughs via imitation learning, the new system overcomes a serious limitation of the older one with respect to stochastic games (when memorizing a single optimal solution is ineffective). Additionally, learning allows search-based automated play to be bootstrapped from examples of human play styles or even from the best of its own past experiences. In this paper we demonstrate that our framework discovers higher-scoring and more-representative play with minimal need for machine learning or search expertise.},

Test automation has been used in order to reduce testing time of online game servers. In this paper, we propose the VENUS II system, which supports blackbox testing and scenario-based testing as well as simple load testing. The massive virtual clients automatically generate packet loads to test the stability of game servers like the existing approaches. The main difference, however, is that we used the game grammar and game map to describe the game logics instead of using dummy game client code. So the test client code doesn't need to be re-written when a new game is to be tested. And the complex scenarios such as attack, party play and waypoint movement can be tested and moreover effectively because the scenarios can be flexibly constructed by combining protocols and actions already defined in game grammar.

Therefore, test automations have been used in order to reduce the testing time of online games by simulating highly repetitive tasks and emulating server loads.

In this paper, we propose black box testing and scenario-based testing of online games as well as simple load testing. Instead of rewriting the virtual client dummy code, only the game description language and virtual game map are redefined when a new game is to be tested. In addition, an actual testing environment can be mimicked more closely, because complex and various scenarios such as attack, party play, and waypoint movement can be tested through combining actions.

While functional testing is typically performed manually by the QA staff members, there is a large number of scenarios that can be automated, and readily available instruments, such as Appium and Calabash, designed for this task. Automated smoke testing is especially challenging for the applications with nonstandard GUI, such as games made with Unity. The only viable option in this case is to analyze screen content as a flat image and identify GUI elements with pattern matching algorithms. This approach is not novel, but its practical applicability and limitations are rarely discussed. We consider a case study of a mobile tennis game project, developed in Unity and covered with a suite of Appium-supported functional tests. We show how image matching capabilities of OpenCV library can be used in Appium tests to build a reliable automated QA pipeline.},

These ﬂaws can result in situations where the players cannot continue the game as planned (for example due to dead- or livelocks).

This is done by generating a Petri Net where the individual game elements are mapped to appropriate constructs. We do so not only for high level goals, but for each possible user interaction. Combining this approach with an automatic transformation of the game yields a huge beneﬁt: there is no need to develop a veriﬁcation model in parallel to the game and there is also no margin for inconsistencies that could lead to the model not accurately representing the game.},

We take advantage of the fact that a video game, contrarily to generic software, follows a special structure that contains a "game loop", this game loop can be used to centralize the instrumentation and generate events based on the game's internal state. We report on experiments made on a sample of five real-world video games of various genres and sizes, by successfully incrementing and efficiently monitoring various temporal properties over their execution-including actual bugs reported in the games' bug tracking database in the course of their development.},

This profitability can be ascribed to the popularity that new technologies such as smartphones and tablets have acquired over the last few years. To increase competitiveness, we use a model driven engineering (MDE) approach to develop multi-platform videogames in a quick and easy manner. MDE helps us to reduce the number of errors, the amount of time required and the development costs and favors a productivity increment. The aim of this work is to present an approach for the agile development of multi-platform videogames by using high-level abstraction models. We offer a feasible solution supported by a tool that allows the development of videogames in a simple and agile way. An empirical validation is presented through a use case where the viability of our approach is shown in comparison with that of other tools. Finally, a survey shows the users' perception of the solution with the objective of validating the use case results. The given use case indicates that our approach is suitable for improving videogame development. The survey indicates that users think that it is possible to model videogames and generate the corresponding applications with our approach.},

	abstract = {© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York. The steadily increasing popularity of computer games has led to the rise of a multi-billion dollar industry. This increasing popularity is partly enabled by online digital distribution platforms for games, such as Steam. These platforms offer an insight into the development and test processes of game developers. In particular, we can extract the update cycle of a game and study what makes developers deviate from that cycle by releasing so-called urgent updates. An urgent update is a software update that fixes problems that are deemed critical enough to not be left unfixed until a regular-cycle update. Urgent updates are made in a state of emergency and outside the regular development and test timelines which causes unnecessary stress on the development team. Hence, avoiding the need for an urgent update is important for game developers. We define urgent updates as 0-day updates (updates that are released on the same day), updates that are released faster than the regular cycle, or self-admitted hotfixes. We conduct an empirical study of the urgent updates of the 50 most popular games from Steam, the dominant digital game delivery platform. As urgent updates are reflections of mistakes in the development and test processes, a better understanding of urgent updates can in turn stimulate the improvement of these processes, and eventually save resources for game developers. In this paper, we argue that the update strategy that is chosen by a game developer affects the number of urgent updates that are released. Although the choice of update strategy does not appear to have an impact on the percentage of updates that are released faster than the regular cycle or self-admitted hotfixes, games that use a frequent update strategy tend to have a higher proportion of 0-day updates than games that use a traditional update strategy.},

	abstract = {Context: The video game industry is a billion dollar industry that faces problems in the way games are developed. One method to address these problems is using developer aid tools, such as Recommendation Systems. These tools assist developers by generating recommendations to help them perform their tasks. Objective: This article describes a systematic approach to recommend development processes for video game projects, using postmortem knowledge extraction and a model of the context of the new project, in which “postmortems” are articles written by video game developers at the end of projects, summarizing the experience of their game development team. This approach aims to provide reflections about development processes used in the game industry as well as guidance to developers to choose the most adequate process according to the contexts they're in. Method: Our approach is divided in three separate phases: in the first phase, we manually extracted the processes from the postmortems analysis; in the second one, we created a video game context and algorithm rules for recommendation; and finally in the third phase, we evaluated the recommended processes by using quantitative and qualitative metrics, game developers feedback, and a case study by interviewing a video game development team. Contributions: This article brings three main contributions. The first describes a database of developers' experiences extracted from postmortems in the form of development processes. The second defines the main attributes that a video game project contain, which it uses to define the contexts of the project. The third describes and evaluates a recommendation system for video game projects, which uses the contexts of the projects to identify similar projects and suggest a set of activities in the form of a process.},

	abstract = {Mobile games are relatively new industry, and their relevance on the game markets are rising. At the same time, it is very competitive market, as new games are coming out by hundreds every day. The challenges for the new game development come from the creative process and the human factors on how to make the game appealing. In this research, we study the use of test groups as part of new mobile game and concept development process in the early phases. They were used to complement the testing automation at the development phases when use of analytics was not yet possible. Six separate feedback collection sessions were arranged using different methods. The paper presents the main learnings of each used method, the perceived usefulness of the methods for the entire development process. We also contribute to the growing knowledge for mobile game development, focusing on methods for the testing with test user approaches. We conclude that testing with user groups can help clarify the mobile game design to create a more appealing game, but choosing the right groups and right moments in the game development phase can be difficult, as can be the interpretation of the feedback for decision making.},

However, although a computer game is a type of software, the process to conceptualize, produce and deliver a game could involve unusual features. In software testing, for instance, studies demonstrated the hesitance of professionals to use automated testing techniques with games, due to the constant changes in requirements and design, and pointed out the need for creating testing tools that take into account the flexibility required for the game development process. Goal. This study aims to improve the current body of knowledge regarding these theme and point out the existing particularities observed in software testing considering the development of a computer game. Method. A mixed-method approach based on a case study and a survey was applied to collect quantitative and qualitative data from practitioners regarding the particularities of software testing in game development. Results. We analyzed over 70 messages posted on three well-established network of question-and-answer communities and received answers of 38 practitioners, and identified important aspects to be observed in the process of planning, performing and reporting tests games. Conclusion. Considering computer games, software testing must focus not only on the common aspects of a general software, but also, track and investigate issues that could be related to game balance, game physics and entertainment related-aspects to guarantee the quality of computer games and a successful testing process. © 2018 ACM.},

	abstract = {? 2015 Springer-Verlag LondonGames have not received the full attention of the requirements engineering community. This scenario is becoming more critical as we move towards newer forms of games, such as pervasive games. Pervasiveness (the quality that distinguishes pervasive games from traditional digital games) holds several meanings, including being ubiquitous, permeating something, or spreading something, somewhere, in a physical space. Pervasiveness can be recognized in by the boundaries of the game expanding every time it is played, from the virtual (or fictional) world to the real world. Pervasive games are a new form of digital entertainment that has evolved in different forms, such as alternate reality games, transmedia games, and crossmedia games. Sensor technologies, networking capabilities, augmented reality systems, computer vision technology, the internet, and, especially, mobile devices have been responsible for the rapid evolution of this new form of digital product. This paper is focused on ?pervasive mobile games?, which we define as context-aware games that use mobile devices. We bear in mind that mobile devices are currently the main driver for fulfilling the promises of pervasive game playing. Our investigations and experiments on this class of games led us to study the quality requirements for pervasive mobile games. Using different information sources, we gathered a set of interrelated characteristics that are crucial to the success of these games. In this paper, we begin to clarify the definition and scope of pervasive mobile games, which are controversial issues in the literature. Using these fundamentals, we propose a two-level conceptual map of non-functional requirements that helps to realize pervasiveness in pervasive mobile games. These non-functional requirements are then associated with a set of questions that help the designers in verifying tasks and operationalizing the requirements of a game. We also propose a dependence matrix for pervasive game qualities that enhances the insight into pervasiveness and reveals important guidelines for the game designers.},

To this pur-pose, we conducted a mixed, qualitative and quantitative study on a broad suite of 60 OSS projects. Our results confirm the existence of significant differences between game and non-game development, in terms of how project resources are organized and in the diversity of developers' specializations. Moreover, game developers respond-ing to our survey perceive more difficulties than other developers when reusing code as well as performing automated testing, and they lack a clear overview of their system's requirements.},

This research facilitates a better understanding of important dimensions of digital game development methodology.

The framework of this model consists of assessment questionnaires, a performance scale, and a rating method. The main goal of the questionnaires is to collect information about current processes and practices. In general, this research contributes towards formulating a comprehensive and unified strategy for game development maturity evaluation. Two case studies were conducted and their assessment results reported. These demonstrate the level of maturity of current development practices in two organizations.},

	abstract = {Software game is a kind of application that is used not only for entertainment, but also for serious purposes that can be applicable to different domains such as education, business, and health care. Multidisciplinary nature of the game development processes that combine sound, art, control systems, artificial intelligence (AI), and human factors, makes the software game development practice different from traditional software development. However, the underline software engineering techniques help game development to achieve maintainability, flexibility, lower effort and cost, and better design. The purpose of this study is to assesses the state of the art research on the game development software engineering process and highlight areas that need further consideration by researchers. In the study, we used a systematic literature review methodology based on well-known digital libraries. The largest number of studies have been reported in the production phase of the game development software engineering process life cycle, followed by the pre-production phase. By contrast, the post-production phase has received much less research activity than the pre-production and production phases. The results of this study suggest that the game development software engineering process has many aspects that need further attention from researchers; that especially includes the postproduction phase.},

	abstract = {Independent developers and large-scale development studios - commonly seen as the Davids and Goliaths of the video game industry - are moving closer together. Powerful software frameworks, traditionally reserved for professional developers and only available through expensive licenses, are becoming free to use for consumers. By sharing their tools instead of keeping them for themselves, companies can utilize the combined talent of whole communities and monetize on that talent through royalties and other indirect fees. This paper describes how the video game industry has developed in recent years to allow for this change in business strategy and examines how the industry can continue to evolve because of this. The result of a Delphi study based on interviews with game developers both inside and outside the industry point toward a future of increased intermingling and sharing of knowledge and resources, characterized by more producer-consumer collaborations and closer relationships between companies and their communities. By adopting free-to-use business models and sharing powerful, proprietary software with their consumers, companies are lowering the point of entry for aspiring developers and thereby dissolving the traditional narrative of “we and them” that has existed between independent developers and established studios in the past.},

These approaches usually adopt agile methodologies because of claims that traditional practices and the waterfall process are gone. However, are the "old days" really gone in the game industry? In this paper, we present a survey of software engineering processes in video game industry from postmortem project analyses. We analyzed 20 postmortems from Gamasutra Portal. We extracted their processes and modelled them through using the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). This work presents three main contributions. First, a postmortem analysis methodology to identify and extract project processes. Second, the study main result: the "old days" are gone, but not completely. Iterative practices are increasing and are applied to at least 65\% of projects in which 45\% of this projects explicitly adopted Agile practices. However, waterfall process is still applied at least 30\% of projects. Finally, we discuss some implications, directions and opportunities for video game development community.},

Our findings indicate that there is no single model that serves as a best practice process model for game development and it is a matter of deciding which model is best suited for a particular game. Agile models such as Scrum and XP are suited to the knowledge intensive domain of game development where innovation and speed to market are vital. Hybrid approaches such as reuse can also be suitable for game development where the risk of the upfront investment in terms of time and cost is mitigated with a game that has stable requirements and a longer lifespan. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

The objective of this study is to provide a better understanding of the developer's dimension as a factor in software game success. It focuses mainly on an empirical investigation of the effect of key developer's factors on the software game development process and eventually on the quality of the resulting game. A quantitative survey was developed and conducted to identify key developer's factors for an enhanced game development process. For this study, the developed survey was used to test the research model and hypotheses. The results provide evidence that game development organizations must deal with multiple key factors to remain competitive and to handle high pressure in the software game industry.

Studies and professional reports have shown the " ugly face " behind the game industry.

We sought for answers based on empirical data collected from the questionnaire. The goal was to understand the area and provide insights to improve game development, pointing a direction for future researches. As a result, considering the Brazilian context, this paper presents three main contributions. The first shows that, on projects that used sys-tematic approaches, regardless of the type, result in better prod-ucts. The second presents that Delays, Unrealistic scope and Lack of documentation are the most common problems faced by game developers. Finally, we describe insights and considerations gath-ered from developers and literature studies, which may serve as a source of knowledge as well as characterization of the Brazilian game developers.},

Yet, only game designers have been able to capitalize on methods that are consistently able to keep their users engaged. Consequently, software engineers have been increasingly interested in understanding how these game experiences can be transferred to programming experiences, a process termed gamification. In this perspective paper, we offer a formal argument that gamification as applied today is predominately narrow, placing emphasis on the reward aspects of game mechanics at the expense of other important game elements, such as framing. We argue that more authentic game experiences are possible when programming environments are re-conceptualized and assessed as holistic, serious games. This broad gamification enables us to more effectively apply and leverage the breadth of game elements to the construction and understanding of programming environments.},

Nevertheless, video games - speci?c types of software products - focus strongly on user interface and game design. Thus, engineering processes, methods for game construction and veri?cation/validation, and best-practices, derived from traditional software engineering, might be applicable in context of video game development. We selected the Austrian games industry as a manageable and promising starting point for systematically capturing the state-of-the practice in Video game development. In this paper we present the survey design and report on the ?rst results of a national survey in the Austrian games industry. The results of the survey showed that the Austrian games industry is organized in a set of small and young studios with the trend to ad-hoc and ?exible development processes and limitations in systematic method support.},

The wider market for computer games now exceeds the annual global revenues of cinema. We have, however, only a limited scholarly understanding of how games studios produce games. Games projects require particular attention because their context is unique. Drawing on a case study, the paper offers a theoretical conceptualization of the development process of creative software, such as games software. We found that the process, as constituted by the interactions of developers, oscillates between two modes of practice: routinized and improvised, which sediment and flux the working rhythms in the context. This paper argues that while we may predeterminately lay down the broad stages of creative software development, the activities that constitute each stage, and the transition criteria from one to the next, may be left to the actors in the moment, to the temporality of the situation as it emerges. If all development activities are predefined, as advocated in various process models, this may leave little room for opportunity and the creative fruits that flow from opportunity, such as enhanced features, aesthetics and learning.},

An investigation of factors leading to success or failure in video game development suggests that many failures can be traced to problems with the transition from preproduction to production. Three examples, drawn from real video games, illustrate specific problems: 1) how to transform documentation from its preproduction form to a form that can be used as a basis for production, 2) how to identify implied information in preproduction documents, and 3) how to apply domain knowledge without hindering the creative process. We identify 3 levels of implication and show that there is a strong correlation between experience and the ability to identify issues at each level. The accumulated evidence clearly identifies the need to extend traditional requirements engineering techniques to support the creative process in video game development. ? 2005 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Game testing has been long recognized as a notoriously challenging task, which mainly relies on manual playing and scripting based testing in game industry. Even until recently, automated game testing still remains to be largely untouched niche. A key challenge is that game testing often requires to play the game as a sequential decision process. A bug may only be triggered until completing certain difficult intermediate tasks, which requires a certain level of intelligence. The recent success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) sheds light on advancing automated game testing, without human competitive intelligent support. However, the existing DRLs mostly focus on winning the game rather than game testing. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we first perform an in-depth analysis of 1349 real bugs from four real-world commercial game products. Based on this, we propose four oracles to support automated game testing, and further propose Wuji, an on-the-fly game testing framework, which leverages evolutionary algorithms, DRL and multi-objective optimization to perform automatic game testing. Wuji balances between winning the game and exploring the space of the game. Winning the game allows the agent to make progress in the game, while space exploration increases the possibility of discovering bugs. We conduct a large-scale evaluation on a simple game and two popular commercial games. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of Wuji in exploring space and detecting bugs. Moreover, Wuji found 3 previously unknown bugs, which have been confirmed by the developers, in the commercial games.},

	doi = {10.1109/MODELS.2015.7338274},
	abstract = {Game development has recently gained a lot of momentum and is now a major software development industry. Platform games are being revived with both their 2D and 3D versions being developed. A major challenge faced by the industry is a lack of automated system-level approaches for game testing. Currently in most game development organizations, games are tested manually or using semi-automated techniques. Such testing techniques do not scale to the industry requirements where more systematic and repeatable approaches are required. In this paper we propose a model-based testing approach for automated black box functional testing of platform games. The paper provides a detailed modeling methodology to support automated system-level game testing. As part of the methodology, we provide guidelines for modeling the platform games for testing using our proposed game test modeling profile. We use domain modeling for representing the game structure and UML state machines for behavioral modeling. We present the details related to automated test case generation, execution, and oracle generation. We demonstrate our model-based testing approach by applying it on two cases studies, a widely referenced and open source implementation of Mario brothers game and an industrial case study of an endless runner game. The proposed approach was able to identify major faults in the open source game implementation. Our results showed that the proposed approach is practical and can be applied successfully on industrial games.},

Financial success for games studios often depends on making games that deliver a fun and engaging experience for a diverse audience of players. Therefore, understanding how players interact and behave during gameplay is of vital importance. Playtesting aims to assist developers to achieve their design intent and help to identify and resolve potential problem areas during development. However, playtests are not always feasible or affordable for smaller, independent game developers (indie studios) because they require specialized equipment and expertise. In addition to this, there is a lack of research on the value of playtesting for indie studios, which means most indie developers are not convinced of the value of user research and playtesting. This paper reports on our collaboration with six commercial indie developers conducting eleven rounds of playtesting session. Through these collaborations, our paper contributes to this growing domain by highlighting the value of playtesting for indie developers and discussing the user research process and approaches based on indie developers' needs and budget.},
