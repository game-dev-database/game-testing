This imbalance is a problem if video game development differs from general software development, as some game experts suggest. In this paper we describe a study with 14 interviewees and 364 survey respondents. The study elicited substantial differences between video game development and other software development. For example, in game development, “cowboy coders” are necessary to cope with the continuous interplay between creative desires and technical constraints. Consequently, game developers are hesitant to use automated testing because of these tests’ rapid obsolescence in the face of shifting creative desires of game designers. These differences between game and non-game development have implications for research, industry, and practice. For instance, as a starting point for impacting game development, researchers could create testing tools that enable game developers to create tests that assert flexible behavior with little up-front investment.","2014","2021-02-26 20:18:32","2021-02-26 20:18:32","2020-11-04 15:48:06","1-11","","","","","","Cowboys, ankle sprains, and keepers of quality","","","","","ACM Press","Hyderabad, India","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/pol4ko/snap/zotero-snap/common/Zotero/storage/GR3MSPEI/Murphy-Hill et al. - 2014 - Cowboys, ankle sprains, and keepers of quality ho.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","the 36th International Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One method to address these problems is using developer aid tools, such as Recommendation Systems. These tools assist developers by generating recommendations to help them perform their tasks. Objective: This article describes a systematic approach to recommend development processes for video game projects, using postmortem knowledge extraction and a model of the context of the new project, in which “postmortems” are articles written by video game developers at the end of projects, summarizing the experience of their game development team. This approach aims to provide reflections about development processes used in the game industry as well as guidance to developers to choose the most adequate process according to the contexts they're in. Method: Our approach is divided in three separate phases: in the first phase, we manually extracted the processes from the postmortems analysis; in the second one, we created a video game context and algorithm rules for recommendation; and finally in the third phase, we evaluated the recommended processes by using quantitative and qualitative metrics, game developers feedback, and a case study by interviewing a video game development team. Contributions: This article brings three main contributions. The first describes a database of developers' experiences extracted from postmortems in the form of development processes. The second defines the main attributes that a video game project contain, which it uses to define the contexts of the project. The third describes and evaluates a recommendation system for video game projects, which uses the contexts of the projects to identify similar projects and suggest a set of activities in the form of a process.","2018","2021-02-26 20:18:37","2021-02-26 20:18:37","","103–118","","March","100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier","","","","Recommendation system; Software development process; Video game development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The challenges for the new game development come from the creative process and the human factors on how to make the game appealing. In this research, we study the use of test groups as part of new mobile game and concept development process in the early phases. They were used to complement the testing automation at the development phases when use of analytics was not yet possible. Six separate feedback collection sessions were arranged using different methods. The paper presents the main learnings of each used method, the perceived usefulness of the methods for the entire development process. We also contribute to the growing knowledge for mobile game development, focusing on methods for the testing with test user approaches. We conclude that testing with user groups can help clarify the mobile game design to create a more appealing game, but choosing the right groups and right moments in the game development phase can be difficult, as can be the interpretation of the feedback for decision making.","2018","2021-02-26 20:18:37","2021-02-26 20:18:37","","1–8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9781538662984","","/home/pol4ko/snap/zotero-snap/common/Zotero/storage/FFHIBR99/Annanperä et al. - 2018 - Testing methods for mobile game development a case.pdf","","development process; game testing; methods; mobile games; users","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the last several decades, computer games started to have a significant impact on society. However, although a computer game is a type of software, the process to conceptualize, produce and deliver a game could involve unusual features. In software testing, for instance, studies demonstrated the hesitance of professionals to use automated testing techniques with games, due to the constant changes in requirements and design, and pointed out the need for creating testing tools that take into account the flexibility required for the game development process. Goal. This study aims to improve the current body of knowledge regarding these theme and point out the existing particularities observed in software testing considering the development of a computer game. Method. A mixed-method approach based on a case study and a survey was applied to collect quantitative and qualitative data from practitioners regarding the particularities of software testing in game development. Results. We analyzed over 70 messages posted on three well-established network of question-and-answer communities and received answers of 38 practitioners, and identified important aspects to be observed in the process of planning, performing and reporting tests games. Conclusion. Considering computer games, software testing must focus not only on the common aspects of a general software, but also, track and investigate issues that could be related to game balance, game physics and entertainment related-aspects to guarantee the quality of computer games and a successful testing process. © 2018 ACM.","2018","2021-02-26 20:18:37","2021-02-26 20:18:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/home/pol4ko/snap/zotero-snap/common/Zotero/storage/4TDCN4WF/Santos et al. - 2018 - Computer games are serious business and so is thei.pdf","","Automated testing; Body of knowledge; Computer games; Established; Software design; Software testing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This scenario is becoming more critical as we move towards newer forms of games, such as pervasive games. Pervasiveness (the quality that distinguishes pervasive games from traditional digital games) holds several meanings, including being ubiquitous, permeating something, or spreading something, somewhere, in a physical space. Pervasiveness can be recognized in by the boundaries of the game expanding every time it is played, from the virtual (or fictional) world to the real world. Pervasive games are a new form of digital entertainment that has evolved in different forms, such as alternate reality games, transmedia games, and crossmedia games. Sensor technologies, networking capabilities, augmented reality systems, computer vision technology, the internet, and, especially, mobile devices have been responsible for the rapid evolution of this new form of digital product. This paper is focused on ?pervasive mobile games?, which we define as context-aware games that use mobile devices. We bear in mind that mobile devices are currently the main driver for fulfilling the promises of pervasive game playing. Our investigations and experiments on this class of games led us to study the quality requirements for pervasive mobile games. Using different information sources, we gathered a set of interrelated characteristics that are crucial to the success of these games. In this paper, we begin to clarify the definition and scope of pervasive mobile games, which are controversial issues in the literature. Using these fundamentals, we propose a two-level conceptual map of non-functional requirements that helps to realize pervasiveness in pervasive mobile games. These non-functional requirements are then associated with a set of questions that help the designers in verifying tasks and operationalizing the requirements of a game. We also propose a dependence matrix for pervasive game qualities that enhances the insight into pervasiveness and reveals important guidelines for the game designers.","2017","2021-02-26 20:18:37","2021-02-26 20:18:37","","137–165","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dependence matrix; Non-functional requirements; Pervasive mobile games; Requirements engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we consider video game development in the open source system (OSS) context. Specifically, we investigate how de-velopers contribute to video games vs. non-games by working on different kinds of artifacts, how they handle malfunctions, and how they perceive the development process of their projects. To this pur-pose, we conducted a mixed, qualitative and quantitative study on a broad suite of 60 OSS projects. Our results confirm the existence of significant differences between game and non-game development, in terms of how project resources are organized and in the diversity of developers' specializations. Moreover, game developers respond-ing to our survey perceive more difficulties than other developers when reusing code as well as performing automated testing, and they lack a clear overview of their system's requirements.","2018","2021-02-26 20:18:37","2021-02-26 20:18:37","","392–402","","","","","","","","","","","","Gothenburg, Sweden","","","","","","","","ISSN: 02705257","","","","Human computer interaction; Industrial research; Int","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Powerful software frameworks, traditionally reserved for professional developers and only available through expensive licenses, are becoming free to use for consumers. By sharing their tools instead of keeping them for themselves, companies can utilize the combined talent of whole communities and monetize on that talent through royalties and other indirect fees. This paper describes how the video game industry has developed in recent years to allow for this change in business strategy and examines how the industry can continue to evolve because of this. The result of a Delphi study based on interviews with game developers both inside and outside the industry point toward a future of increased intermingling and sharing of knowledge and resources, characterized by more producer-consumer collaborations and closer relationships between companies and their communities. By adopting free-to-use business models and sharing powerful, proprietary software with their consumers, companies are lowering the point of entry for aspiring developers and thereby dissolving the traditional narrative of “we and them” that has existed between independent developers and established studios in the past.","2016","2021-02-26 20:18:37","2021-02-26 20:18:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","business model; community platforms; game development; game engine; indie; modding; outsourcing innovation; participatory culture; producer-consumer collaboration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Agile models such as Scrum and XP are suited to the knowledge intensive domain of game development where innovation and speed to market are vital. Hybrid approaches such as reuse can also be suitable for game development where the risk of the upfront investment in terms of time and cost is mitigated with a game that has stable requirements and a longer lifespan. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.","2014","2021-02-26 20:18:37","2021-02-26 20:18:37","","182–193","","June","425","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9783662438954","","","","Game Development; Software Engineering; Software Process; Software Process Improvement (SPI); Systematic Literature Review (SLR)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Game development is a complex process, and one important game development choice is to consider the developer's perspective to produce good-quality software games by improving the game development process. The objective of this study is to provide a better understanding of the developer's dimension as a factor in software game success. It focuses mainly on an empirical investigation of the effect of key developer's factors on the software game development process and eventually on the quality of the resulting game. A quantitative survey was developed and conducted to identify key developer's factors for an enhanced game development process. For this study, the developed survey was used to test the research model and hypotheses. The results provide evidence that game development organizations must deal with multiple key factors to remain competitive and to handle high pressure in the software game industry.

However, none of the existing GDLCs explicitly address how to successfully deliver a good quality game. This paper presents a new game development life cycle model and guidelines to successfully deliver a good quality game. Several quality criterias are explicitly considered at each phase. ? 2013 IEEE.","2013","2021-02-26 20:18:37","2021-02-26 20:18:37","","95–100","","June","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9789791421195","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Programming environments and game environments share many of the same characteristics, such as requiring their users to understand strategies and solve difficult challenges. Yet, only game designers have been able to capitalize on methods that are consistently able to keep their users engaged. Consequently, software engineers have been increasingly interested in understanding how these game experiences can be transferred to programming experiences, a process termed gamification. In this perspective paper, we offer a formal argument that gamification as applied today is predominately narrow, placing emphasis on the reward aspects of game mechanics at the expense of other important game elements, such as framing. We argue that more authentic game experiences are possible when programming environments are re-conceptualized and assessed as holistic, serious games. This broad gamification enables us to more effectively apply and leverage the breadth of game elements to the construction and understanding of programming environments.","2016","2021-02-26 20:18:37","2021-02-26 20:18:37","","134–142","","","2016-Novem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9781509002528 Publisher: IEEE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The wider market for computer games now exceeds the annual global revenues of cinema. We have, however, only a limited scholarly understanding of how games studios produce games. Games projects require particular attention because their context is unique. Drawing on a case study, the paper offers a theoretical conceptualization of the development process of creative software, such as games software. We found that the process, as constituted by the interactions of developers, oscillates between two modes of practice: routinized and improvised, which sediment and flux the working rhythms in the context. This paper argues that while we may predeterminately lay down the broad stages of creative software development, the activities that constitute each stage, and the transition criteria from one to the next, may be left to the actors in the moment, to the temporality of the situation as it emerges. If all development activities are predefined, as advocated in various process models, this may leave little room for opportunity and the creative fruits that flow from opportunity, such as enhanced features, aesthetics and learning.","2009","2021-02-26 20:18:49","2021-02-26 20:18:49","","479–497","","5","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer game; Software development process; Temporal structure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three examples, drawn from real video games, illustrate specific problems: 1) how to transform documentation from its preproduction form to a form that can be used as a basis for production, 2) how to identify implied information in preproduction documents, and 3) how to apply domain knowledge without hindering the creative process. We identify 3 levels of implication and show that there is a strong correlation between experience and the ability to identify issues at each level.

However, playtests are not always feasible or affordable for smaller, independent game developers (indie studios) because they require specialized equipment and expertise.

Some studies that deal with the evaluating the OSS quality, concerns use user’s survey approach focusing on the usability aspects. The empirical investigations to evaluate the quality concerns of the design, using internal code attributes, needs attention of researchers.

Play-testers are not professionals that are involved in the process of RE. They are not professional testers, either. Yet, their feedback in terms of perceptions and experiences of the early prototypes of a game, have a decisive impact on what the RE-professionals do next in the RE process. This position paper presents a qualitative study that sought to discover who takes the role of play-testers and what kind of feedback play-testers generate in the early stages of RE for games. The case study responds to the observation that no textbook on RE or software engineering addresses play-testing as a phenomenon, and that classic Computer Science programs at universities teach testing techniques mostly in the context of embedded systems, hence students often are left with little opportunity to develop testing skills that build upon play-testing practices happening in the game development sector.

This thesis investigates the question of whether the testing and validation of computer graphics implementations for cross-platform game development can be automated to reduce the burden on human testers, accelerate the testing phase, and improve the quality of games. Using Design Science Research methods and patterns, iterative development and evaluation is undertaken to construct artefacts, drawing upon prior research and industrial works in related fields such as film and television, as well as proprietary game development insight. Elements of existing automated testing systems and image comparison techniques are combined with industry standard cross-platform development tools and methods to create a reusable and generalisable model of an automated test system, featuring image comparison methods, and record and playback techniques for cross-platform game implementations.

This data has become a viable source for developers to guide decision-making throughout the game design process and even after the game has been released, for example, to identify balancing issues (Kim, et al., 2008; Zoeller, 2010), to understand player movement (Moura, El-Nasr and Shaw, 2011), to reduce production costs (Hullett, et al., 2011), or to uncover bugs (Zoeller, 2010), to name but a few. At the same time, the increasing popularity of online multiplayer gaming has attached great importance to in-game statistics to allow players to recap their performance and to compare it with others. This growing interest in game telemetry data is reflected by the emergence of the new field of game analytics--concerned with the discovery and communication of meaningful patterns in data as applied in the context of game development and game research (cf. El-Nasr, Drachen and Canossa, 2013). Game analytics heavily relies on visualization techniques to assist developers and players alike to understand, analyze, and explore the data (cf. Wallner and Kriglstein, 2013). Visualizations in game research can be helpful to discover unexpected paths which have been taken by the players, to identify possible design and balancing problems, or to find common patterns in the behavior of the players. Moreover, since the rich interaction possibilities provided by a game can give rise to emergent behavior which is hard to anticipate, visualizations can assist in exploratory data analysis helping the analyst to discover potentially interesting structures, trends, and anomalies not thought of beforehand.","2015-01-01","2021-02-26 20:18:54","2021-02-26 20:18:54","2020-11-04","231–250","","","","","","","","","","","ETC Press","Pittsburgh, PA, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","/home/pol4ko/snap/zotero-snap/common/Zotero/storage/X3FKX585/Wallner and Kriglstein - 2015 - An introduction to gameplay data visualization.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So far, testing a game’s functional features relies mainly on human testers, who personally plays the game, and is thus labor intensive. This paper proposes a method that automates game testing. Since games are usually built on top of game frameworks, the idea is to enhance a game framework with a testing layer, which can execute (playback) test scripts that perform user events and assert the correctness of the game. We design an HTML5 game framework with such a support. In addition, a case study is performed to compare the testing cost of three different methods: writing a test script directly, recording a test script, and testing the game directly by a human tester. The results showed that when repeated testings are necessary, an automatic testing (either writing or recording test scripts) can reduce human cost. Among these three testing methods, recording scripts was the most favored method.","2016","2021-02-26 20:18:54","2021-02-26 20:18:54","","13-26","","","","","","","Studies in Computational Intelligence","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/home/pol4ko/snap/zotero-snap/common/Zotero/storage/JU4NKHSR/Chen et al. - 2016 - A Game Framework Supporting Automatic Functional T.pdf","","","Game Developer; Human Tester; Human Time; Mobile Game; Testing Cost","Lee, Roger","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The advancements the industry has been enjoying motivated researches to propose techniques and tools to support the activities across the different phases of the game development lifecycle. Game testing is one of the crucial activities within the game development process. Due to the nature of game testing, many automated game testing techniques have been proposed in the literature. However, there is no framework that could be used to aid practitioners in selecting appropriate techniques suitable for their particular development efforts. In this paper we present an attribute-based framework to classify and compare these techniques and provide such aid to practitioners. The framework is also meant to guide researchers interested in proposing new game testing techniques. The paper discusses a number of prominent techniques against the framework. Analysis of the discussion reveals gaps and suggests open points for future research.","2020","2021-02-26 20:18:54","2021-02-26 20:18:54","","1-1","","","","","","Video Game Automated Testing Approaches","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Games","","/home/pol4ko/snap/zotero-snap/common/Zotero/storage/B5BSWQJ6/Albaghajati and Ahmed - 2020 - Video Game Automated Testing Approaches An Assess.pdf","","","Assessment Framework; Data mining; Evolutionary computation; Game Development; Game Testing; Games; Industries; Playtesting; Search engines; Software; Software Testing; Testing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MCTS and its enhancements are controlled by multiple parameters that require extensive and time-consuming offline optimization. Moreover, as the played games are unknown in advance, offline optimization cannot tune parameters specifically for single games. This paper proposes a self-adaptive MCTS strategy (SA-MCTS) that integrates within the search a method to automatically tune search-control parameters online per game. It presents five different allocation strategies that decide how to allocate available samples to evaluate parameter values. Experiments with 1 s play-clock on multiplayer games show that for all the allocation strategies the performance of SA-MCTS that tunes two parameters is at least equal to or better than the performance of MCTS tuned offline and not optimized per-game. The allocation strategy that performs the best is N-Tuple Bandit Evolutionary Algorithm (NTBEA). This strategy also achieves a good performance when tuning four parameters. SA-MCTS can be considered as a successful strategy for domains that require parameter tuning for every single problem, and it is also a valid alternative for domains where offline parameter tuning is costly or infeasible.","2020-06","2021-02-26 20:19:22","2021-02-26 20:19:22","","132–144","","2","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/home/pol4ko/snap/zotero-snap/common/Zotero/storage/WA7D85ZD/Sironi et al. - 2020 - Self-Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree Search in General G.pdf","","adaptive Monte Carlo tree search; allocation strategy; Combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB); computer games; evolutionary algorithms; evolutionary computation; Evolutionary computation; Games; general game playing; general game playing (GGP); Monte Carlo methods; multiplayer games; multiple parameters; N-tuple bandit evolutionary algorithm; N-tuple systems; offline parameter tuning; on-line parameter tuning; Optimization; parameter values; played games; Resource management; SA-MCTS; search-control parameters; self-adaptive MCTS strategy; single games; time-consuming offline optimization; tree searching; Tuners","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our primary contribution is to combine AI gameplay using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with a simulation of how the player population evolves over the levels. The AI players predict level difficulty, which is used to drive a player population model with simulated skill, persistence, and boredom. This allows us to model, e.g., how less persistent and skilled players are more sensitive to high difficulty, and how such players churn early, which makes the player population and the relation between difficulty and churn evolve level by level. Our work demonstrates that player behavior predictions produced by DRL gameplay can be significantly improved by even a very simple population-level simulation of individual player differences, without requiring costly retraining of agents or collecting new DRL gameplay data for each simulated player.","2020-11","2021-02-26 20:19:22","2021-02-26 20:19:22","2020-11-05","585–593","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/home/pol4ko/snap/zotero-snap/common/Zotero/storage/6J7ZWKWX/Roohi et al. - 2020 - Predicting Game Difficulty and Churn Without Playe.pdf","","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; I.2.6; I.6.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A bug in general mobile application can be compromised in its first release but this might not work for a 2D or 3D gaming application. Any deficit in performance, graphics, logic and compatibility is simply rejected in the current saturated market. The testing approaches used for 3D visualization applications are either manual based or using automated testing tools, although one needs to be fully equipped with the domain knowledge and working of the automated tool for it to be useful. In this paper, we have proposed an adaptive usage based statistical testing (A-UBST) that adapts with the user experiences. This technique enables the quality engineers and testers to focus on the frequently accessed parts of SUT (software under test). We have used Markov Models to represent usage models.

When testing a computer game the problem has an extra dimension, namely the virtual world where the game is played on. This world often plays a dominant role in constraining which logical states are reachable, and how to reach them. So, any automated testing algorithm for computer games will inevitably need a layer that deals with navigation on a virtual world. Unlike e.g. navigating through the GUI of a typical web-based application, navigating over a virtual world is much more challenging. This paper discusses how concepts from geometry and graph-based path finding can be applied in the context of game testing to solve the problem of automated navigation and exploration.
