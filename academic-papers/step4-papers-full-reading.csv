A properly formed requirement is testable, a necessity for ensuring that design goals are met. While challenging in productivity applications, entertainment applications such as games compound the problem due to their subjective nature. We report here on our efforts to create testable experience requirements, the associated scope challenges and challenges with test design and result interpretation. We further report on issues experienced when performing focus group testing and provide practitioner guidance.","2015","2021-02-26 20:18:32","2021-02-26 20:18:32","","324–333","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9781467369053 Publisher: IEEE","","","","design goal; Experience requirements; testing; user experience; validation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Game testing can be used to measure the game quality. Unfortunately, most game testing use user-centric approach to test the quality of the game. In this paper, we propose a game testing method, which is developed from the existing game testing approach supplemented with software testing approach to measure the game quality. The game quality was derived from software engineering quality model standards and game quality model. The proposed game testing method is applied to several case studies. The case studies have demonstrated how to assess the games in order to obtain the meaningful results. The research found that the game quality results can be used by game developers to improve the game.","2014","2021-02-26 20:18:32","2021-02-26 20:18:32","","1–6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9781479979967 Publisher: IEEE","","","","game; measurement; quality; testing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Little work has been done on the emerging digital game industry. In this paper we explore how data can drive game design and production decisions in game development. We define a mixture of qualitative and quantitative data sources, broken down into three broad categories: internal testing, external testing, and subjective evaluations. We present preliminary results of a case study of how data collected from users of a released game can inform subsequent development.","2011","2021-02-26 20:18:32","2021-02-26 20:18:32","","940","","","80","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9781450304450","","","","game design; game development; game metrics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is unique in that it combines the work of teams covering multiple disciplines (art, music, acting, programming, etc.), and that engaging game play is sought after through the use of prototypes and iterations. With that, game development is faced with challenges that can be addressed using traditional SE practices. The industry needs to adopt sound SE practices for their distinct needs such as managing multimedia assets and finding the ldquofunrdquo in game play. The industry must take on the challenges by evolving SE methods to meet their needs. This work investigates these challenges and highlights engineering practices to mitigate these challenges.","2009","2021-02-26 20:18:32","2021-02-26 20:18:32","","260–265","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9780769535968 Publisher: IEEE","","","","Challenges; Diverse assets; Process; Project management; Project scope; Publishing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This imbalance is a problem if video game development differs from general software development, as some game experts suggest. In this paper we describe a study with 14 interviewees and 364 survey respondents. The study elicited substantial differences between video game development and other software development. For example, in game development, “cowboy coders” are necessary to cope with the continuous interplay between creative desires and technical constraints. Consequently, game developers are hesitant to use automated testing because of these tests’ rapid obsolescence in the face of shifting creative desires of game designers. These differences between game and non-game development have implications for research, industry, and practice. For instance, as a starting point for impacting game development, researchers could create testing tools that enable game developers to create tests that assert flexible behavior with little up-front investment.","2014","2021-02-26 20:18:32","2021-02-26 20:18:32","2020-11-04 15:48:06","1-11","","","","","","Cowboys, ankle sprains, and keepers of quality","","","","","ACM Press","Hyderabad, India","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/pol4ko/snap/zotero-snap/common/Zotero/storage/GR3MSPEI/Murphy-Hill et al. - 2014 - Cowboys, ankle sprains, and keepers of quality ho.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","the 36th International Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
